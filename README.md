This repository provides the code for identifying potential Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposon (LTR-RT) tandem loci.

## INSTALLATION
First, to obtain the repository from GitHub:

```git clone: https://github.com/NMoralesD/IDENTAM```


## REQUIREMENTS
IDENTAM requires the installation of TEsorter. 
All the information necessary for installation can be found at: https://github.com/zhangrengang/TEsorter

Also, IDENTAM requires bedtools. 
All the information neccesary for installation can be found at: https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/bedtools/README.html

## USAGE
For identifying potential LTR-RT Tandems with IDENTAM we need 3 input files:  
- A transposable element (TE) library with LTRs and internal regions annotated separately
- A reference genome
- A Repeatmasker output 

Then, to run IDENTAM type: 


```sbatch mods/identify_tandems_2modulesv3.sh path/to/reference path/to/TE_library path/to/RepeatMasker_output Distance_between_internal_regions Minimum_internal_region_lenght Minimum_element_lenght Distance_between_LTRs  Maximum_locus_lenght Accession_name```

As seen in the code, several parameters could be modified. The standard parameters are shown in the next lines. 
- Distance_between_internal_regions: 5000 bp
- Minimum_internal_region_lenght: 500 bp
- Minimum_element_lenght: 1000 bp
- Distance_between_LTRs: 15000 bp
- Maximum_locus_lenght: 40000 bp
- Accession_name: Specie's name 

### OUTPUTs
In the results folder you will find the following: 
+ LTR-RT_TR.tsv  A file with the genomic positions of potential LTR-RT Tandems, as well as the related family according to TEsorter, information about their completeness and their domains.
+ LTR-RT_related.tsv  A file with the genomic positions of potential LTR-RT related Tandems, as well as the related superfamily family according to TEsorter.

## Methods
IDENTAM detects potential LTR-RT Tandems through two different methods.

### METHOD 1 
It detects two close (â‰¤ 5Kb) internal LTR-RT regions from the same family. Then, it checks for surrounding LTRs and creates a bed file with potential LTR-RT Tandems.
### METHOD 2
It detects three close LTRs from the same family. Then, it checks if there are internal LTR-RT regions from the same family between the LTRs and creates a bed file with potential LTR-RT Tandems.
