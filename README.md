This repository constains the code for identifying potential LTR-retrotransposons (LTR-RT) tandem loci.

## INSTALLATION
First, to obtain the repository from GitHub:
git clone: ADRESS
cd IDENTAM

## REQUIREMENTS
IDENTAM requires also the installation of TEsorter. 
All the information neccesary for installation can be find in: https://github.com/zhangrengang/TEsorter
Also, IDENTAM requires bedtools. 
All the information neccesary for installation can be find in: https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/bedtools/README.html

## USAGE
For identifying potential LTR-RT Tandems it is neccesary three input files are needed: 
- Transposable Element (TE) library with LTRs and internal regions annotated separately
- Reference genome
- Repeatmasker output 

Then, to run IDENTAM type: 


```sbatch mods/identify_tandems_2modulesv3.sh path/to/reference path/to/TE_library path/to/RepeatMasker_output Distance_between_internal_regions Minimum_internal_region_lenght Minimum_element_lenght Distance_between_LTRs  Maximum_locus_lenght Accession_name```

### OUTPUTs
In the results folder you will find: 
+ LTR-RT_TR.tsv  A file with the genomic positions of potential LTR-RT Tandems, as well as the related family according to TEsorter, information about their completeness and their domains.
+ LTR-RT_related.tsv  A file with the genomic positions of potential LTR-RT related Tandems, as well as the related superfamily family according to TEsorter.

## Methods
IDENTAM detects potential LTR-RT Tandems through two different methods.

### METHOD 1 
It detects two close (â‰¤ 5Kb) internal LTR-RT regions from the same family. Then, it checks if there are surrounding LTRs and creates a bed file with potential LTR-RT Tandems.
### METHOD 2
It detects three close LTRs from the same family. Then, it checks if there are internal LTR-RT regions from the same family between the LTRs and creates a bed file with potential LTR-RT Tandems.
